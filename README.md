# coastal-monitoring

This github repo includes all relevant data about a project idea to use drones for coastal monitoring. It was worked on this project in a class about drones of the master ASPIC at the university of Bordeaux. The master ASPIC is a specialized master in computer science that focuses on robotics and drones. The idea was provided by two students of this class, Marouane and Alexis. The implementation was done by Youssef Blaiha and Valentin Noske. The goal of the project was first of all to create a unity simulation of the business idea and second of all to try to use this simulation to sell the idea in a fictional conversation with investors. 

GardeCote_Unity:
This folder includes our unity project. The unity project consists of two scenes (Illegal_Cargo, Sinking_Boat). The scenes can be launched by selecting the respective one in the build options. 
During the simulation the camera can get changed via pressing the key 'c'. 

Documents:
This folders includes the presentation of the project idea presented from the perspective of a startup that wants to launch its business. Furthermore, it includes the description of the project idea provided by Marouane and Alexis. Both documents are only available in French. 

Videos_Simulation:
You can find two videos here that show the two scenes that we created with unity to simulate the project idea. The first one shows a drone detecting illegal cargo. The second one shows a drone finding a sinking boat. 

Pictures_Simulation:
You can find two folders here that show pictures of the two scenes that we created with unity to simulate the project idea. The first one shows a drone detecting illegal cargo. The second one shows a drone finding a sinking boat.
